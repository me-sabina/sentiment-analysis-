INTRODUCTION:
   In an era where consumer sentiment drives market trends, understanding the emotional responses 
towards a product is paramount for business success. This proposal advocates for a sentiment 
analysis endeavor focused on Product. By harnessing the power of natural language processing, 
we aim to uncover valuable insights from online feedback, empowering Business to enhance 
product satisfaction and customer engagement strategies. 
This sentiment analysis project seeks to delve into the vast pool of online feedback, 
encompassing customer reviews, social media discussions, and other digital platforms where 
opinions about Product are expressed. By harnessing advanced natural language processing 
(NLP) techniques, we aim to systematically analyze and categorize the sentiments conveyed in 
these diverse sources of data.

OBJECTIVE:
    a. To create a webpage that allows customer to view the product as well as review it accordingly. 
    b. To create a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying customer reviews.  
    c. To design and develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to input      
       reviews, visualize sentiment analysis results, and explore insights easily.
